# Settings for speeding up Tig in large repositories
#
# To use these settings copy the file to your HOME directory and include
# it from your ~/.tigrc file:
#
#	$ ln tig/.tigrc.large ~/.tigrc.large
#	$ echo "source ~/.tigrc.large" >> ~/.tigrc

# Use Git's default (reverse chronological) order, never automatically
# use topo-order for the commit graph
set commit-order = default

# Limit number of commits loaded by default to 1000
set main-options = -n 50

# Don't show staged and unstaged changes in the main view
# set show-changes = no

# Smaller main-view
set main-view = line-number:no,interval=5 id:no date:default author:full,width=20 commit-title:yes,refs,overflow=no

# Optionally, use the old and faster but less acurate graph renderer
#Â set main-view-commit-title-graph = v1

# Conventional Commits

This Skill helps create commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits specification and include the required Claude Code footer.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope][optional !]: <description>

[optional body]

[required footer]
```

## Types

- **feat**: New feature for the user or library
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies (Cargo.toml, Dockerfile, CI)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, tooling changes

## Scope Examples

- `feat(cli):` - CLI-related feature
- `fix(parser):` - Parser bug fix
- `build(docker):` - Docker build changes
- `docs(readme):` - README updates

## Breaking Changes

Indicate with `!` after type/scope:
```
feat!: drop support for count=0
```

Or use `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:
```
feat: change default emoji pool

BREAKING CHANGE: removed deprecated emojis from pool
```

## Required Footer

**ALWAYS include this footer:**

```

## Instructions for Creating Commits

1. **Run git diff to understand changes:**
   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   # or
   git diff
   ```

2. **Analyze the changes** to determine:
   - Appropriate type (feat, fix, docs, build, etc.)
   - Optional scope (cli, docker, ci, etc.)
   - Whether it's a breaking change
   - Clear, concise description (imperative mood)

3. **Draft commit message** following the template in `commit-template.txt`

4. **Use heredoc format for multi-line commits:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat: add emoji category support

   Adds categorization system for emojis (animals, food, symbols).
   Users can now filter by category using --category flag.

   EOF
   )"
   ```

## Best Practices

- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed"
- Keep summary under 50 characters when possible
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Reference issue numbers in body if applicable
- Always include the Claude Code footer
- Use body for context if the change needs explanation

## Error Prevention

**DO NOT:**
- Forget the Claude Code footer
- Use past tense ("added", "fixed")
- Write vague descriptions ("update stuff", "fix bug")
- Skip the body when breaking changes need explanation
- Commit without running git diff first

**DO:**
- Always check staged changes first
- Use clear, specific descriptions
- Include body for context when needed
- Use appropriate type and scope
- Include the required footer

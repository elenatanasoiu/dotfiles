# Usage
# <prefix> [ to start “copy-mode” (Not sure what <prefix> is? This post can help)
# Move to the text you want to copy using Vim-like key bindings, i.e., k to move up a line, / to search, etc.
# v to start selection
# Move to end of text with Vim key-bindings. The selection will be highlighted
# y to copy the highlighted/selected text
# The selected text is now in your clipboard, and your day is that much better for it.

# SIMPLE WAY TO COPY THAT I ALWAYS FORGET ABOUT
# Hold down ALT and select with your mouse. And then Cmd-C.

# Navigate through windows:
# Prefix + N and Prefix + P

# Experimental
# Loads copied content from tmux into system clipboard and tmux pasteboard
# Basically, what it does is that it will capture contents of current pane,
# create horizontal split, strip empty lines from saved pane contents and
# then loads them to Vim in read-only mode, scrolls to bottom of Vim buffer,
# sets default clipboard to system, and then after closing Vim, loads content
# in system clipboard back to tmux pasteboard, so you will end up with having
# your copied selection in both system clipboard and tmux pasteboard
